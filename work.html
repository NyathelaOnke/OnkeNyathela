                        <P>This is my recent website. I started the project as a template of a blog or rather as a reference of how I would design the blog. br
                        This helps when dealing with people that are not sure of what they want. It helps as a point of reference. The website has no back-end.
                        The reason is because use I can not currently afford hosting fees to host the website and try and learn how the back-end works.
                        The website is not fully responsive as I have been still working on it and wish to ad more features such as the dashboard and login forms.

                            This is one of my recent websites. 
                            The website is mean for a multimedia journalist of almost any one that want to have a portfolio.
                            The website is meant to allow the client to choose the colors they want, the font they want and the design they like and not like.
                            This makes it easy for the client to have an input in the beginning stages of their website. This makes things easier for me when I give them the first graft since I already know what their interest mostly are.
                            This website is only front-end as I can not currently afford hosting for the backend part.

                            The website was meant for a small flower business with the hopes it would be the first draft and it would interest the business to getting a website from me and thus help with my hosting issues.
                            However, due to the pandemic the business did not survive and thus I now use it as a template for a small e-commerce website.
                            The website is short of the login full form although it has some frontend login form I am hoping to be able to ad the backend of the login form and the cart feature.
                            The website was my first attempt on e-commerce and hope to be able to work in more projects similar to this one as it is a fun ongoing project.

                            This is the first website I have created 'fully'. The website is for a small practice.
                            I chose the website to be less 'flashy' as the other ones. The reason is that the clientele of the business might appreciate something less 'flashy'.
                            However, since it was my first website it does require some revamping since I have learn a few things since I worked on the website. 
                            The bigest thing I wanted is to implement a booking feature on the website and I will be happy.
                        </P>
